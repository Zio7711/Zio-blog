Let’s talk about Array methods.

We work with data every day. The world itself is data. When we work with data in programming, we widely use the array to store and process the data.

> But… Are we using the right method at right place to process the array of data?

To be honest… I see a lot of developers still use the map and filter method to print the array element. A lot of them still don’t know the reduce, some, and every method. And some of them only use the forEach everywhere.

So here I have described the **13 most used array methods** in easy words.

# forEach

- The forEach() method **calls a callback function** once for each array element
- The callback function takes **3 arguments:**
  \- value
  \- index
  \- array itself

# map

- It is **used to map** the array data
- It **creates a new array** and does not change the original array
- The returned array has the **same length** as the input array

# filter

- Used to **filters the array** based on the given condition
- It also **creates a new array** and does not modify the original array.
- **Return an empty array** if array elements do not match with the given condition
