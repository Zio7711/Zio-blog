Thanks for visiting my website! This website uses Hexo framework and Fluid Theme.

I am a full-stack web developer. I love coding and exploring new tech stacks. Now I am familiar with JavaScript / React / Vue / Express / Node / PostgreSQl etc.

In my opinion, a web developer should not be limited to only one or two languages or frontend and backend fields. Every languages and frameworks have their own advantages and disadvantages. Only if you have tried it out or have had experience of it, you would be calling it out right away when you need it next time.

I often write my blogs as well to summarize what I have learnt recently. If you have any suggestions or advice, please reach me through email.

Thanks for reading again.
